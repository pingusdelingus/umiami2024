\begin{statement}{Equation of accounting} %You can use theorem, exercise, problem, or question here.  Modify x.yz to be whatever number you are proving
Assets = Liabilities + Equity
Assetes = Liabilities + Common Stock - Dividends + Revenue- Expense\\
Accounts payable := short term credit payments due(usually less than 1 yr, credit card to buy inventory, etc.)
notes payable := long term credit payments due (usually over 1 yr long loans from bank, etc.)

Revenue increases equity
when expenses increase, equity decrease(opposite of revenue)

Accounts receievable is money owed from customer on credit

Dividends paid out reduce equity(obviously reduce cash from payment)


Common mistakes in populating excel tables: Remember to put '-' to decrease
if Assets != Libailities + Equity then there is a mistake in the table
\end{statement}
 

\begin{statement}{income Statement, statement of retained earnings and balance sheet}

Income Statement := Revenues - Expenses = Net income

Statement of retained earnings := retained earnings(prev. earnings) +net income - dividend = ending retained earnings(time based)

Cash Flow Statement := all of cash cources that company received, and payments that company made





\end{statement}
 
\begin{statement}{Practice Excercises}


  Given Assets and Liabilities, calculate equity
 Use accoutning equation A = L + E
 subsitutue and linearly combine

 1.10:\\
 A = L + E\\
 Cash + Accounts Receivable = Accounts Payable + CommonStock - Dividends + Revenues - Expensees
 a. The company completed consulting work for a client and immediately completed 5,500 cash\\

 Cash(+5,500) + Accounts Receivable = Accounts Payable + CommonStock - Dividends + Revenues(5,500) - Expensees

b. The comapny completed work for a client that was sent a bill of 4000, to be paid within 30 days.\\
 Cash(+5,500) + Accounts Receivable(4,000) = Accounts Payable + CommonStock - Dividends + Revenues(5,500)+(4,000) - Expensees
